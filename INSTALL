Prerequisites
=============

You need to have Python 2.2 or higher (Python 2.3 is required for
MS Windows Tray Module). You can download Python from
<http://www.python.org/download/>.

You also need version 2.4.0.7 or higher of the wxPython package.
On MS Windows platform wxPython version must be 2.4.0.7 because 
wxTimeCtrl is broken in later versions hopefully it willl change
soon, but before the further announcement you ought to use the 
aforementioned version. Unix versions are free of this limitation.

Main Application (wxApp.py) will run on Unix (tested on RH 9)
provided you have Python 2.2 or higher and wxPython (with GTK) 
2.4.0.7 or higher.

For the MS Windows Tray Module you also need to have the pywin32 
extensions  installed (pywin32-200 or above), which you can get 
from <http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond>.

To build Microsoft Windows binary files from python source 
you need py2exe distutils extension  version 0.50 or above which you 
can get from <http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/py2exe/>. 

To buld Context Menu Module for Windows Explorer you need 
MinGW-3.1.0-1 and mingw32-make-3.80.0-3 or later. You can get
these packages from <http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml>

To build the setup program you need InnoSetup 4.18 or higher and
ISTool 4.18 or higher. You can get InnoSetup from 
<http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php> and ISTool from
<http://www.istool.org/downloads.aspx>

And of course you need the excellent GPL Antivirus Toolkit - 
Clam Antivirus (ClamAV). You can get the latest version from www.clamav.net

To build ClamAV for MS Windows you need Cygwin which you can het from 
<http://www.cygwin.com>


Getting the software
====================

If you don't already have it, you can download the latest release of
WinClamAV for MS Windows or the source code from 
<http://www.cher.id.au/winclamav/download>.


Installation
============
For you convenience a binary package for MS Windows has been put to
SourceForge download area for the project.

If you wish to build WinClamAV from the source tree then read below.

The first thing you need to do put Clam Antivirus source tree in
clamav-devel folder and build the binaries on Cygwin.
Then change directory to Setup/py2exe and run python setup_all.py, this
will put windows binary files in Setup/py2exe/dist directory.
To build the setup program you need to run 
ISTool -compile <full path to the Setup.iss>. This should produce
Setup/Output/setup.exe file.
